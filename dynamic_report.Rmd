## YouTube Ad Insights: Trends and Engagement

This report analyzes **YouTube advertisements** based on their placements (pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll, and banner ads) and user engagement.

### Key Findings:
- A total of **`r total_ads`** ads were recorded in this dataset.
- The most frequently seen ad placement was **`r most_common_ad_type`**.
- On average, users saw each ad **`r round(avg_frequency, 2)`** times per day.

### Ad Frequency by Placement

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Context, y = Frequency, fill = Context)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Ad Frequency by Placement", x = "Ad Placement", y = "Total Views") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Engagement Levels Across Ads

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Ad_Appeal, fill = Ad_Appeal)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Engagement Levels of Ads", x = "Engagement Rating", y = "Count of Ads") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Conclusion

This dynamic report highlights the distribution and engagement of YouTube ads. Future analysis could explore ad effectiveness by **brand** or **content category**.
